This is a rebundling of some Simile widgets for use in Django projects.
This is mostly in support of Freemix in advance of a migration to Exhibit 3.

Templates are separated into css and js, and depend on django-compressor (http://django_compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

TODO
====
* Locale support
* Map Views other than the OpenLayers widget
* An example project with the Exhibit demos
